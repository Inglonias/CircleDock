## Development Status
This is a personal repository based on the only extant source code I can find for CircleDock, which is [this SourceForge page](https://sourceforge.net/projects/circledock/). I created the repository, cleaned up the existing code so that it can be compiled and run easily with modern versions of VS2019, and put it on GitHub. While I can say with certainty that there were more advanced versions of this software available online in the past, I cannot find any freely available source code newer than this, and because of that, cannot comment on features that CircleDock did or did not have at some point. I am not going to decompile code written by someone else and put it onto GitHub. I can promise that all of the commits that I create are based on my own work, and not on any code newer than what is found here.

As of Sept 30, 2020, I have tried to contact the email addresses listed at the WikiDot site to ask what, if anything, I need to do to continue development without getting into legal trouble. If I receive a response, I will place it here.
